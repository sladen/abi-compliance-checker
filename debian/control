Description: Compare ABI compatibility of shared C/C++ library versions
 This can be used to help reduce the possibility of an application
 crashing when the shared libraries it links against have changed.
 Signatures and data type definations from two separate versions of a
 library are compared by examining the shared objects (.so) files
 themselves, and by analysing the header files (.h) provided for the
 two versions of the library and their dependencies.
 .
 Shared library developers trying to strive for binary compatibility
 between releases may also use this tool to detect if an any
 accidental application binary interface (ABI) changes have been
 introduced.
 .
 The checker may also be used for assessing binary compatibility
 between different Linux distributions.
